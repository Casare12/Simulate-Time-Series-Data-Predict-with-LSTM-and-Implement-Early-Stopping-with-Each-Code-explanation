Here is a portion of the Code:
# Calculate the split index for 80% training and 20% testing
split_index = int(timesteps * 0.8)  
# Calculate the index that corresponds to 80% of the total number of time steps, to split the data into training and testing sets.

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_df = df.iloc[:split_index]  
# Select the first 80% of the data for the training set using slicing.
test_df = df.iloc[split_index:]  
# Select the remaining 20% of the data for the testing set using slicing.

# Separate the features and the target variable for training and testing
X_train = train_df.drop(columns=['Target']).values  
# Extract training features by dropping the 'Target' column and converting the DataFrame to a NumPy array.
y_train = train_df['Target'].values  
# Extract the training target variable as a NumPy array.
X_test = test_df.drop(columns=['Target']).values  
# Extract testing features by dropping the 'Target' column and converting the DataFrame to a NumPy array.
y_test = test_df['Target'].values  
# Extract the testing target variable as a NumPy array.
